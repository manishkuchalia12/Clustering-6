    "Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confusion matrix is a fundamental tool for evaluating the performance of a classification model.\n",

    "Usage:\n",

    "It is used to calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity.\n",
    "It helps in understanding how well a model is performing across different classes.\n",
    "Identifying Strengths and Weaknesses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: A confusion matrix reveals the model's ability to correctly classify instances (true positives and true negatives).\n",
    "Weaknesses: It highlights areas where the model makes errors, such as false positives and false negatives.\n",
    "Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the confusion matrix, one can identify which classes are well-predicted and which may need improvement. This information is crucial for model refinement.\n"
